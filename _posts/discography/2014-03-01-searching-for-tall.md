I've been playing with Lauren for a few years, after being enlisted by my old compadre Conrad Tracey. We have a shared interest in rhythm sections playing tastefully and minimally over songwriters from the 1970s, and we figured we could do a similar job with Lauren. Live, it's probably some of the sparsest pop music I've played, the kind of thing that just sucks all the air out of the room (in a good way) and people just can't help but shut up and listen. So it was great to finally put it down on tape too, thanks to Richard Stolz.

Available on iTunes, and here's a video:
