A bit of a cold case release, I'm glad this one has made it out into the world. After a bit of detective work listening to it, being pretty sure some of it sounds like me, feeling like I remember playing some of it, asking Felix about it and looking at old invoices I sent, I can say I definitely played on...some of it! It's me on Gloria and Dreamers, Follow, it sounds like me on Black Room...okay probably all of it actually. The only one I'm really not sure about is White Walls. It might be John Castle on that. It happened at a few studios at a few different times. I kind of wish I'd taken better notes when it happened. Mind you, nobody keeps track of the songs they DIDN'T play on, so it's hard to figure out years later.
