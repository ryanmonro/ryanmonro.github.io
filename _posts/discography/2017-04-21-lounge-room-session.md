Hey, wow, I didn't even know this got released! I was just looking around on Spotify for release dates of Felix's other stuff while I was updating my website, and I found this. A nice little time capsule of the gigs we did at Felix's house in 2017. Felix, Danny Farrugia, Ross Irwin and Ben Edgar. What a team. I'm glad there's a recording of us doing this stuff live. I think we ate too much Ethiopian food beforehand one night, and I had to inhale a burrito the other night because I didn't leave enough time for anything else. It turned out great, from memory Lachlan Wooden recorded and mixed it. Somebody drops a glass at the start of Lonely Truth too, nice to hear that made it in.
