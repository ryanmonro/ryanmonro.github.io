I'm Ryan Monro from Melbourne, Australia. I play music, and I also write code. Sometimes I manage to do both at the same time. Musically, I'm best known as the upright and electric bassist for The Cat Empire. 

So why play music and write code? What I love about coding is your logic has to be exactly right: you can't get away with being ambiguous or not having thought something through. And I guess I like music for the opposite reason.
