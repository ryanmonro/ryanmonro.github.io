Released: 2003.

We were about to go on tour, but didn’t have a CD to sell, and the self-titled album wasn’t finished yet, so Andy helped us put together this EP. Some re-mixed tracks from The Sun, some tracks recorded for the album that didn’t make the cut, and some very fake crowd noise. Some of the tracks played back at the wrong speed (a symptom of importing 48kHz tracks into a 44.1kHz Pro Tools session, or the other way around) but they still kind of worked. But Song for the Day shouldn't be in E minor, that's for sure.

Gear: 3/4 Czech flatback ply upright bass and a Fishman BP-100 pickup recorded direct.
