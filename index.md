I'm Ryan Monro from Melbourne, Australia. I play music, and I also write code. Sometimes I manage to do both at the same time. Musically, I'm best known as the upright and electric bassist for The Cat Empire. 

So why play music and write code? What I love about coding is your logic has to be exactly right: you can't get away with being ambiguous or not having thought something through. A computer will only do exactly what you tell it to, so you have to be sure you're explaining it correctly. Every time I explain music to a computer, I learn more about the things I take for granted in music, and how people play and listen to it. Considering how complicated it is when you break it down, it can seem like a miracle that music happens at all.
