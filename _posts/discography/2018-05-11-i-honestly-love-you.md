This is the album Delta Goodrem released around the time the Olivia Newton John biopic aired on Australian TV. I wrote a post about the recording of that [here](discography/2018/05/13/hopelessly-devoted-to-you.html). I didn't have to get off the couch for this to happen, but I guess I can put Delta on my CV now. I played on everything except that one extra song recorded with Olivia for the album. I'm not sure who did that.

It's available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/11lHEjfJmLeEUb5uLiAn5v?si=BGZl09VxSgWmQ9JoDE7V9Q).
