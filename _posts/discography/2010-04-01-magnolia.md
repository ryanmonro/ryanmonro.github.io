Man, this was a fun recording. We started off playing some Lanois tunes at Luke’s house, then booked in some studio time. By the time I got home, Luke and Lenny had emailed everybody demos of a bunch more songs. I wrote another one later that night. Working fast! We all played as though we were leaving room for vocals (which were recorded on a few tracks), but over the next few months we all realised how well it worked without vocals. If we had aimed for it to be instrumental from the get-go, would it have turned out so well? Who knows.
