I recorded this one a while back at Jan's studio with Will Hull-Brown on drums, and had a great time. I'm glad it's finally out in the wilderness. It's one of my favourites from the album, which will be out later in the year. Rolling Stone called what I did in the second verse a "mellowed-out Alt-J-esque bass drop", which was surprising for a few reasons. Firstly because mellowed out and bass drop seem contradictory, and secondly because bass drop?! Back in my day that was called a "Disney slide" or a "porno slide", but I guess with distortion there's nothing Disney or porno about it. I guess I should be thankful that a two-paragraph review would bother mentioning what the bass is doing. Here's a live video of the song we shot in mid-2016 too:
