## The short version: 
I'm Ryan Monro from Melbourne, Australia, best known as the upright and electric bassist for The Cat Empire.

## The long version: 
I'm Ryan Monro, a musician from Melbourne, Australia. I am a founding member of Melbourne-based band The Cat Empire, which first began in late 1999 and has since led me around the globe playing more than 1000 live shows, recording seven albums and selling over one million records. Some highlights have been recording our second album Two Shoes in Havana, Cuba; a show at the Royal Albert Hall in London in 2015; festival gigs at Glastonbury, Montreal Jazz Festival, Winnipeg Folk Festival, Rock am Ring and Rock im Park in Germany, Lowlands, and many others; TV appearances on The Late Show with David Letterman and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno; and of course the buzz of our first ever residency at the Prince Bandroom in St Kilda back in 2001. I'm also one third of The Genie, long-standing jazz/fusion/dub/electronic collaboration with fellow Cats Ollie McGill and Will Hull-Brown with two albums currently under their belt. I've also been involved in the live and recorded side of Felix Riebl's solo releases, and Harry Angus's folktronica project Jackson Jackson. 

As a freelance sideman I've also performed and/or recorded with Maceo Parker, Paul Kelly, Archie Roach, Robert Forster, Kate Ceberano, Tim Rogers, Delta Goodrem, Megan Washington, Ella Hooper, Julia Stone, Luke Howard, Lance Ferguson, Sally Seltmann, Saskwatch, The Meltdown, Barbari√∂n, Roscoe James Irwin, Eagle and the Worm, Owl Eyes, Thomas Bartlett (Doveman), Sam Amidon and Bryce Dessner (The National). I studied music at the Victorian College of the Arts, and also found time to complete a Master of Computing at RMIT University. I live in Fitzroy with my wife and our dog. We named the dog Indiana.
