I'm coming towards the end of three months off in Melbourne. I don't currently have a dayjob, so I've been taking advantage of some downtime at home. Seeing family. Walking the dog. Swimming a few times a week. Staying healthy. 

I've done a few gigs with the Meltdown, and have jammed with Jan, Pete and Brett about once a month since the start of the year. That might turn into a band one day. We'll probably record later in the year. 

Other than that I have been pretty busy getting [wired in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRBSKaTDrqQ) with music in the browser:
- I got into Tone.JS, culminating in the [Mondrian sequencer](/projects/2019/04/15/mondrian-sequencer.html) I built. 
- I read [the book](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/) on Generative Design in P5, and am gradually heading towards integrating that with what I've been doing with audio. 
- I'm catching up on iOS Development (a lot has changed since 2013!) and learning Swift as a result. I guess the endgame there is building some sort of musical native iOS app. 

You know when you were a kid, playing with Lego, and you'd get so into it that you didn't realise how much time was passing? That's what I call The Lego Zone. It's been satisfying to get into that zone with programming again. It's been a while.
