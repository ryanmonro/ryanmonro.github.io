Recorded: Jan’s house, late 2009
Released: September 2010.

Bass on tracks 2-5.

Gear: Fender Precision Highway One, Sansamp Bass Driver. A bit of Maxon AD-999 slapback delay on 1+1. David Gage Czech Ease upright bass on Fire Hotel, over a loop of Paul Simon’s 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover. That’s the closest I’ll come to playing with Steve Gadd!
