I decided at the end of week six that, while I’d been having a great time writing a blog about the course at General Assembly and it was nice to have people on campus say that they were enjoying reading it, I’d been spending too much time on it and should really knuckle down and spend the time I should be spending on learning web development on actually learning web development rather than blogging about how much web development I was learning, which I actually wasn’t, because I’d been spending too much time blogging about it. So I gave myself a few days off. By Wednesday night I came to the realisation that the rest of the week would be filled up with Hackathon (more on that later) and at best I would probably only have time for one post about the whole week. But I’m glad I took those first two days off. I had Rails to wrap my head around. Rails was another case of, “Now that you’ve learned how to do it the tedious way and can appreciate how it’s actually working, you don’t need to do it anymore because Rails does it for you.” That brings us to one of the three things I want to talk about in this post.

## Magic

I’ve been thinking for a few weeks about how there is good-sensible-reuse-of-someone-else’s-code and bad-lazy-generic-reuse-of-someone-else’s-code, and as a newbie it can be hard to tell which one you’re employing. Good-sensible-reuse and bad-lazy-reuse aren’t a particularly catchy way of putting it, so I was glad to hear DT say this week, “There’s good and bad magic.” That’s exactly the kind of short, sharp, bumper-sticker-worthy summary that I was trying to think of and DT is famous for. So there are good and bad kinds of magic in the programming world. Good magic is of the “there’s no need to reinvent the wheel”* variety. Sure, technically you could write a web server from scratch in the backend language of your choice, but people have already done that so well, you might as well stand on their shoulders and focus on building all the parts of your site that make your site your site. So you type one line of code that brings in all the hard work somebody else did. Now you’ve got a web server and it does all the things you need. But it’s not magic just yet. Rails takes it a few steps further: if you name all your files and classes and tables in the way that it expects, it will do a lot of the work for you without you needing to configure everything. Good magic.

But it’s possible to reuse so much code that you end up with a website that looks like everyone else’s. Let’s stick with the reinventing the wheel metaphor for a while longer. If you’re building a car, the car needs wheels and, lucky for you, somebody has already invented them. Cars already exist too, but you can’t reuse the whole thing. As a car manufacturer you’re in the business of building cars to sell to other people and you’d better be sure your car is distinctive. But that doesn’t quite explain why the Toyota 86 and the Subaru BRZ are exactly the same car with different badges. Seriously, they’re the same car. Front-engined, rear-wheel-driven, two-doored, cheap and cheerful in the scheme of things, made in the same factory, and as one of my friends summed them up, “If I was a fucking idiot, I’d get one.” I couldn’t quite tell if he meant idiot in the “fiscal idiot” sense or the “driving like an idiot” sense, but it’s possible he meant both. Your choice really comes down to brand perception and availability. Toyota means “Japanese and will last forever and my Dad has one”, and Subaru means “Japanese and it looks like I care about the environment for some reason despite the fuel economy being not all that good and actually my Dad has one.” It depends what your Dad has. Hang on, how did we get here? Wasn’t I talking about web development? Oh yeah. I’d categorise Bootstrap as bad magic. It makes your site look so instantly just as good as all those other great looking sites that it almost feels like you’ve done something illegal. And hey, those sites look great. But they’re all very…Bootstrappy (that’s another DT-ism). This is bad magic. You’re reusing someone else’s code and it’s doing so much of the work for you that the end result is too generic. As made clear by [Every Fucking Bootstrap Site Ever](http://adventurega.me/bootstrap/). Some people just need a website that gets them from A to B. Bootstrap is not a bad way to go in that case. But if you want something that doesn’t just look like it was tipped out of the can and chucked in the microwave, you’ll have to put in a bit more effort and do some of the work yourself. We were shown Bootstrap this week because our instructors knew we would soon be in a situation where we would need something to look good as well as be functional in a very short time. Why? Because Hackathon.

Hackathon. My god. I’m still not ready to talk about that yet. I know I said I’d talk about three things in this post but this has turned out much longer than I expected already (possibly something to do with that Subaru/Toyota tangent) so to wrap things up quickly here’s some notes I took on a napkin while I was planning this post today.
