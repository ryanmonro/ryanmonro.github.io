note: This page is about the site. The rest of the site is about me. It would be redundant to have an About page about me.

This page was created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in 2018 because I had a feeling I wouldn't live to regret it (unlike iWeb, Wordpress and Indexhibit, for various reasons). It's hosted (for free!) on GitHub. If you're the kind of person who is comfortable editing a whole lot of text files and knows how to use git (you're probably a programmer), then it's a great way to go. I'm using the default Minima theme with very few alterations, but hopefully people see that as a sign that I'm way too busy to care about whether my personal site looks distinctive.
