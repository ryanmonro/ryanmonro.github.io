Recorded: The Shed, December 2007
Bass on track 2 “One Man Band”, and unreleased “Snakes and Ladders”
John Watson on drums, Ben Edgar on guitar, arranged by Ross Irwin, recorded by John Castle. Woo!

Gear: Fender Precision Highway One (probably with some foam under the bridge as a string mute), Sansamp, John Castle’s magic did the rest.

"Hey, can you come and play bass on an EP for Megan?" Little did I know Megan would eventually become THE Megan Washington. AllMusic says I played on the album too, but I'm pretty certain I didn't. I was in the live band around the same time but didn't record anything.
