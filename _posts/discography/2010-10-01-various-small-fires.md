Recorded: Birdland, January 2010
Released: October 2010.

Bass on tracks 4 and 11. A lot of people played on this record, and at some point somebody had to mix it. Not much of what I played survived, but I think I can say I’m responsible for playing a semibreve on the tonic every time the chord changes. That’s about the least notes you can play, without forgetting to come in.

Gear: Fender Precision Highway One, Sansamp Bass Driver DI.
