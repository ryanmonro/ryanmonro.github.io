“Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.” — Alfred North Whitehead

That would have been a much better quote of the day for yesterday, but honestly I couldn’t find it. Without the exact wording all I could find was a whole lot of stuff about Civilization, a computer game from 1991. Nothing about a book about mathematics from 1911. That’s right, he said it in 1911. So he probably wasn’t talking about web development.

Today we increased our Ryan count to an unprecedented **Three Ryans in One Room** when [Ryan Bigg](http://ryanbigg.com/) came in and talked to us. He is a developer who has been working in Ruby for over a decade, wrote the book on Rails (three of them, in fact), and is passionate about teaching others about programming through mentoring and writing. He said he could talk to us about testing, about mentoring, or do a Q&A. We did the Q&A but pretty much asked him about testing and mentoring, so we got all of the above. He said it’s important to get started on contributing to open source projects, but where do you start? One answer is documentation. A lot of documentation is written by people who already understand the thing they’re documenting and end up writing something with too much assumed knowledge for a beginner to get their head around. When Ryan said this I shuddered and thought back to some of my attempts to self-teach myself Javascript earlier this year. A [great post](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/every-javascript-framework-tutorial-written-more-than-5-minutes-ago-f96642d4f05) from earlier this week touched on how confusing a single outdated tutorial can be, but for me the real horrors begin when reading one set of documentation cascades you on to reading further documentation, which in turn leads you to even more documentation, leading to a state of confusion I like to call **Documentation Fatigue**. Or **Getting Stuck in the Dochole**. I haven’t come up with the best name for it yet, to be honest.

Imagine you’ve found a great YouTube tutorial that takes you through all the specific steps of installing Node (a server-side Javascript engine (Javascript’s natural habitat is the browser — running it on the server is a whole new ball game)) and writing a cool thing, like I did with [dude837’s tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA56hmvhWPQ) on writing a server that sends random names to your Max patch. Max is a graphical programming environment favoured by musicians.

Imagine you finish that tutorial and it’s your first toe-in-the-water for writing Javascript in the backend and surprise! you’ve created exactly the thing in the video. You want to do more. You can see this is a great place to build that other thing you’ve been meaning to build, but how do you build anything other than the thing in the tutorial? Where do you go? The website for Node might be a good place to start. It says:

*Node.js’ package ecosystem, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.*

Ah, npm. I remember that from the video. I’d better open the npm website in a new tab. NPM is the home of JQuery, Bootstrap, React and Angular, I’ve vaguely heard of them, I’d better open them all in separate tabs and find out what the hell they are but first of all I’d better look up Express. It looks like you install it via NPM and you can write a web app in about three lines. Okay, it looks pretty straightforward, but what’s this about template engines? Pug? Jade? Mustache? And an article comparing all of them? Ok I’d better keep tabs open on these too. And there’s another one called Handlebars that’s similar to Mustache but I should probably find out why before I do anything else.

By now you’ve read very shallowly about a lot of things and have fifteen tabs open but are no closer to knowing how to extend that app from the tutorial. Nor do you know which of these tabs are about things actually worth knowing about yet, or worth knowing about full stop. Your head spinning from all the acronyms and possible acronyms and things named after stuff hipsters like, it’s probably time for a break. But don’t close that browser window, you’ll lose all the work you’ve done. The work you’ve done opening links in new tabs.

This experience lead me to two decisions:

1. Screw it, I’ll just write it in PHP, at least I know how that works already

1. Maybe I should google “full stack javascript course Melbourne”

And that eventually led me here.

There is no class tomorrow, due to one of our sports-related public holidays. Sadly, it has nothing to do with Huey Lewis and the News’s hit 1983 album [Sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_(Huey_Lewis_and_the_News_album)).
