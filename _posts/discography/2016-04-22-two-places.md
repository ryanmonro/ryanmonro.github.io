I played on the track Two Places, which I was quite happy about because it was always the song I had stuck in my head after the last few gigs of Luke's I'd watched or participated in. It was great to be involved again alongside such monstrous talent, and it reminded me that there are a hell of a lot of ways to play a semibreve on an electric bass. I played my Fender Precision V.
