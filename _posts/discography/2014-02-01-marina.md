As far as I can remember, we recorded this in December 2012, with the same dream team as on Felix's first album. The recording was for some music Felix was putting together for the Sydney Australia Day fireworks, and there's a bit of information about that on his website. At the time it seemed like what we were recording could be the start of another album, but that was further down the track. It's good to see it's been released online too though along with Twisted Line, another track from those sessions.
Some of the lyrics from Marina went on to also become one of my favourite Cat Empire songs: Like a Drum.
