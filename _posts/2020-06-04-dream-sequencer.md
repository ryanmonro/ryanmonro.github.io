I dreamed this one. I'm not sure what the dream was about. All I remember is an interface that looked like the Pip Boy from Fallout 4, with a touch screen showing a graph: the x-axis was time, and the y-axis was frequency. You could tap to add notes, and they would repeat according to their position on the x-axis. I remember being able to play a note every two weeks, if you want to. I woke up and thought, "I think that's worth building." I bumped the two weeks limit up to a year, because why not? I pretty much threw music out the window by not restricting the notes to being in time or in tune, but that was fun for a change.
