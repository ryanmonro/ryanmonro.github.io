This is the album Delta Goodrem released around the time the Olivia Newton John biopic aired on Australian TV. I wrote a post about the recording of that [here](/discography/2018/05/13/hopelessly-devoted-to-you.html). I didn't have to get off the couch for this to happen, but I guess I can put Delta on my CV now. ~~I played on everything except that one extra song recorded with Olivia for the album. I'm not sure who did that.~~

## Epilogue

Over two years later I had another listen and thought, "Hey, that doesn't quite sound like me, I wouldn't have picked every note in You're The One That I Want like that," and I started to have doubts that it was me on this album. Hopelessly Devoted had some note lengths that I would never play, and it was different enough that I thought mixing/mastering couldn't have made me sound like that, so I had some more doubts. Then in Anyone Who Had a Heart I heard a few notes that were definitely played on a five string, and I only played four stringers on the session, so I decided to get to the bottom of it. The [album credits on Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/Delta-Goodrem-I-Honestly-Love-You/release/11959989) show that most of the bass was replayed by [Chris Chaney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Chaney) in LA, where things like this happen. Why did they do this, you might ask? I have no idea. I guess this isn't a "telemovie soundtrack", it's a Delta Goodrem album. So to achieve that, one would book a producer that Delta usually works with (John Shanks), and that producer would do whatever is necessary to get it to sound the way they like things to sound. Like re-playing things. A lot of things went through my mind when I found out about this:

- OMG, Chris Chaney, awesome! 
- I'm so glad my "that doesn't sound like something I'd do" instincts were right â€“ I'm glad I know my own playing that well. Chris Chaney sounds great but the way he does it is not how I'd do it.
- this happens a lot, I probably shouldn't take this personally
- when this happens, you might not even find out unless you read the credits on the album...no wonder so many album credits are disputed
- they replaced some of the other instruments too, so it's not just me
- at least some of our playing made it
- at least it's definitely us on the TV show
- I've gotta get my hands on a copy of the TV version...

So, to sum up, it's me on tracks 8, 9 and 12.
