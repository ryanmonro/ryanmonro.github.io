Bass on the following tracks:

2. That Won't Do
3. Retrograde

Retrograde was hard. It made me realise how warped the (James Blake) original is. I get that a lot with songs I've heard dozens of times but have never sat down and tried to play. The chords change at unique points in the bar. We smoothed out a few of those. But it really makes you notice how not smoothed out James Blake's version is.
