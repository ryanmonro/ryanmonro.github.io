Score composed by Cezary Skubiszewski
Recorded by Adam Rhodes

I played some upright bass (my first session with my big old German bass if I recall correctly) on one part, and the other part was staccato eighth notes on a P-bass tuned to drop C, over a string quartet. Plenty of odd time bars and shifts from double to half time, a real reading workout. Electric bass and strings! What a hip arrangement! Nice work Cezary.
