You can do a cover of an app, right? Can't you? I hope so. This is my cover of the legendary Bloom by Brian Eno and Peter Chilvers, the app which alerted the smartphone world to generative music. You should really head to the app store and [check it out](http://www.generativemusic.com/bloom.html) if you haven't. It seems simple, but as I sat down and tried to write out how it works, I found there's much more to it than there seems. I couldn't make something that behaved exactly the same if I tried. So I didn't. But that was a good lesson to take away from this. What a great thing to aim for in art: misleading simplicity. Make it look simple, but it isn't, and you might not realise how much is going on until you start to dissect it and find details that the simplicity distracted you from.
