Recorded: Ollie’s sister’s bedroom, mid-2000.

More trio tunes. Recorded over a few days. Ollie recorded it. A few Pro Tools incidents, a few nervous “I may have lost the whole session” moments.

Gear: 3/4 Czech flatback ply upright bass. Fishman BP-100 pickup into SWR Workingman’s 12, direct out into Pro Tools. So the amp was only used as a DI. A very heavy one.
