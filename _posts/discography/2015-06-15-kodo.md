I played bass on "Rock When I Go". Actually, it's kind of a funny story: I completely forgot I played on that song. In my defence, it was a few years ago when I played it, and the song didn't have vocals or possibly even a title yet. So it's changed a fair bit. Then, in 2015 when I was listening to the album, I thought, "Hey, that sounds like something I'd do. Actually, it really sounds like something I'd do. That sounds like my Hofner too. Maybe I should ask Jan if it was me." And yeah, it was. I'm pretty sure it was Will Hull-Brown on drums for this one too.

Hear it on [Spotify](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/kodo/992728362).
