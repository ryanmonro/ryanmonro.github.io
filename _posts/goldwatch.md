'PHP, Spotify API, Twitter API'

I built this in PHP in my spare time in early 2017, after realising the Melbourne radio station Gold 104 didn't have a Twitter account that tweets every song they played, and that I could make one myself. It also keeps track of which songs have been played in a database, and can provide stats about most played songs/artists, etc. It also generates its own Spotify playlist.
