This was a lot of fun, I don't get to play this kind of bass usually in my day job. I don't usually get this funky. Or this kind of funky anyway. I had a ball. Catchy song too, it turned out great. Another Jan-recorded Will-drummed special, also with Jesse Hooper in the producer seat. Have a listen [here](https://open.spotify.com/track/7j44uPBARCwO8MgNUSOYnb?si=fsPZ405dQMC2PHnAkNAE0w).
