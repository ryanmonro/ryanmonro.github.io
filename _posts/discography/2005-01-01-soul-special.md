Recorded: The Shed, 2005.

I did backing vocals on track two.

I'm not really a backing singer and definitely not a full forward singer, but I think Ross just wanted everyone he knows involved at some point with this album. I like that. 
I still love Soul Prophet. Great track. Watto (John Watson - drums) kills it. In the best way possible.
