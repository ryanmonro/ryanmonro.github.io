summary: Projects from my time studying at General Assembly
---

In the second half of 2017 I undertook the Web Development Immersive Course at General Assembly, to learn some web dev skills I had heard about but didn't quite know where to start learning about. I worked on four projects during the course:

## Tic Tac Toe (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

Our first assignment at General Assembly was a Tic Tac Toe game in JavaScript. After I made a working game I added animation to draw the board and the players' moves, sound effects, and an AI player who has actually beaten me a few times.

## Leftovrs (Ruby, Sinatra)

For my second project at GA I made an app which allows users to list items of food for sale, find and purchase items from other users, and view their location and proximity with the Google Maps API. It started as a joke ("I wonder if I could sell these noodles online right now...") but was fun and challenging to build.

## Found It (Ruby on Rails)

A location-based game where users post photos of locations, and other users can 'find' them only if their device is close enough to the location. The user who finds the location first wins the most points. The API receives the device's GPS location via AJAX, and returns your distance from the location. The FoundIt button is only revealed if you are close enough.

## Now Playing (React, Node backend)

I built this as my final project for General Assembly: an app that allows you to share the song you are currently playing on Spotify. The backend is an Express.js server which accesses a PostgreSQL database, and the frontend is written in React. Login is achieved via the Spotify API.
