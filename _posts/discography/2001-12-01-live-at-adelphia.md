Recorded: Adelphia, Fitzroy, late 2001 by Ange Andrianakis.

Recorded in one day, mixed the next day. All albums should be made like this.

Gear: 3/4 Czech plywood flatback upright bass. Fishman BP-100 pickup, into SWR Workingman’s 12, direct out only. Possibly recorded on ADAT! I’m glad at least one my studio experiences involved that generation of gear. Digital, but on tape so you can only do linear editing. What a combination. Great for its time though.
