We had a communal lunch at school today, combined with the UX and Data Science classes. The kind of communal lunch where everybody brings something along, and we all share the spoils. I didn’t make it to the last one (I’d already scheduled in a go-home-and-walk-the-dog appointment) but the word on the street was everybody brought bread and dip. Luckily, word had got around about that to almost everybody, and there was a lot more variety this time.

I know a guy who organises a party with two of his friends any time all three of them are in the same city. Only 26 people are invited, each of them are assigned a letter of the alphabet, they have to bring along food or drink that starts with that letter, and the party’s only announced 26 hours before it starts. It’s usually held in the kind of apartment where it would be a bad idea to invite more than 26 people. It’s brilliant. [The website](http://freeundeasysuperparty.com/) ensures two people don’t get the same letter, it guarantees a variety of food (there is not, to my knowledge, a dip for each letter of the alphabet), and even gives you at least three instant conversation starters:
> So, which letter are you? What did you bring? Do you know Luke, Michael or Bethany?

Back to today’s lunch: it’s hard to switch off the App Idea Radar once it’s on, and I instantly regretted not building some sort of full-stack communal lunch dish booking system. It worked out great without an app though, and two guys from my class even collaborated. One handled the coleslaw, the other handled the pulled pork. Then they assembled them, using what they learned about iteration.

      bun.open
      bun.push[coleslaw, pulled_pork, sauce]
      bun.close
    end

Seeing everything as code is another thing that’s hard to switch off, as you can see. That reminds me. I did another warmup this morning. Remember that time in the Simpsons where Selma (or maybe it was Patty) said “You can’t spell obsequious without IOU”? Yes, that was [my warmup today](https://gist.github.com/ryanmonro/ea430ad1b03292535d2ae783605b184a). Come up with more of those. Which words (longer than ten letters, because that’s funnier) contain a commonly used abbreviation?

    You can't spell vicariously without IOU
    You can't spell clarifyingly without FYI
    You can't spell crystalloluminescence without LOL
    You can't spell boastfulness without STFU
